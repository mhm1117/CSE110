## Who am I as a Programmer?

## About Me
I'm from San Francisco and moved to SD for school in 2017! I'm a Cog Sci major specializing in Machine Learning and minoring in CSE. I never know how to phrase it, but i'm in my 3rd year as a transfer student, on my last quarter at UCSD. I'm looking for jobs in a few different fields to start next year and am hoping to find a job back home in SF.

**My Interests outside of school are...**
- Video Games (Ghost of Tsushima, Minecraft, Stardew Valley, and the Assassin's Creed games are some of my favorites!)
- Musical Theater (I think West Side Story and Into the Woods are my favorites, but it's hard to pick)

**I love...** Tea over coffee, swimming in the ocean, cats (especially mine!), going on little adventures, rollercoasters/theme parks, watching shows + video essays about those shows, and also mostly just staying at home all day.
